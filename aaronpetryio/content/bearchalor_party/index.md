### WHAT IS THIS PAGE ABOUT

I am planning on hosting my Bachalor Party in Chicago on the weekend of November 17th and I'd love to see you there!   
&nbsp;

### FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS  
  
**Am I already married?**  
Yes, I will be technically, but the reception is in May, so this still works.  
&nbsp;

### BACK TO THE WHAT  

Why Chicago? Why November?  
  
I thought there was no better way to celebrate my future commitment to Kelley than to show my current commitment to the Chicago Bears. The ~Green Bay Packers~ come to town on Sunday, November 17th and I need to be there to help will them on to victory. I'd love to have you all there with me as we celebrate a new era in my life (the Caleb Williams era).

### DETAILS  

The details aren't ironed out yet, but I'll be flying into town on Thursday, November 14th. I have started to put together some activity ideas, but am still working through finalizing it. I know the things I like to do aren't for everyone, so it's kind of like a choose your own adventure. If you want to participate in one of the activities, awesome! If not, no worries at all. You could do them all, you could do none.
